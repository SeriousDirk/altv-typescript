# Features

A simple Typescript Boilerplate that builds incredibly fast using the [SWC Library](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) and building packages using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

-   Full alt:V Type Support for VSCode
-   Built in auto-copy for non-typescript files.
-   Built in handling of multiple resources for compilation.
-   Building webpack packages where webpack.config.cjs is located
-   Built in server restart after compilation.
-   Easily expandable resource directory.
-   Automatic addition of resources to server.cfg (there are some bugs)
-   [altv-pkg](https://github.com/Stuyk/altv-pkg) support for auto-downloading alt:V Server Binaries.
-   Prettier Configuration for code formatting.
-   Tried and tested and used by the Athena Framework for over 1 year.
-   Examples how to use TypeORM for an AltV project
-   Examples of how to customize AltV's server.cfg to suit your needs

# Installation

-   [Install NodeJS 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
-   [Install GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Clone the Repository

Use the command below in any terminal, command prompt, etc.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Stuyk/altv-typescript
```

## Install the Repository

Use the command below in any terminal, command prompt, etc.

```sh
cd altv-typescript
npm i
```

follow **only step 4** from the [TypeORM website](https://typeorm.io/#installation).

## Configure the Repository

modify the server.cfg:
    -   Fill out the Database Config so the Server can connect to your DB
    -   if you want to add a new Table or Column you just have to edit or add a new enity [here](https://github.com/BotisDerG/altv-typescript-with-typeorm-and-webhook/blob/cb228b49dad086607e71e1191b9aff04982e4d4c/src/core/server/modules/db/entities) (and add it to the entities in the index.ts [here](https://github.com/BotisDerG/altv-typescript-with-typeorm-and-webhook/blob/cb228b49dad086607e71e1191b9aff04982e4d4c/src/core/server/modules/db/index.ts#L15))
    -   If you want to connect to a database type other than "mariadb", you must also edit the index.ts [here](https://github.com/BotisDerG/altv-typescript-with-typeorm-and-webhook/blob/cb228b49dad086607e71e1191b9aff04982e4d4c/src/core/server/modules/db/index.ts#L9)

## Download Server Files

Use the command below in any terminal, command prompt, etc. This will download all necessary server files from an additional package used by this project.

```sh
npm run update
```

## Build Typescript Files and Webpack packages

Use the command below in any terminal, command prompt, etc. This will build your Webpack package and TypeScript code into JavaScript.

```sh
npm run build
```

## Start Production Server (Windows)

Run this command to run the server in production mode.

```
npm run windows
```

## Start Production Server (Linux)

Run this command to run the server in production mode.

```
npm run linux
```

## Start Developer Server (Windows)

Run this command to run the server in development mode.

```
npm run dev
```

## End Server Runtime

Use the key combination `ctrl + c` to kill your server in your terminal, command prompt, etc.

## How to Add Mods, and New Resources

This quickstart repository for Typescript allows mods.

However, **do not put your resources in the `resources` folder**.

Instead you should put resources, mods, etc. in the `src` folder in their own folder. They will be automatically copied to the `resources` folder after the code is transpiled.

## How to add Webpack package

The resource should have a webpack configuration file `webpack.config.cjs`, but it should not be next to `resource.cfg`. 

"webpack.config.cjs" should be a CommonJS module.

Example in the folder with the `chat` resource.

## How to formatting with Prettier

Run this command to formatting all file (exclude `resources`) with Prettier

```
npm run formatting
```
